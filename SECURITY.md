   - Potential impact
   - Suggested remediation (if known)

## Disclosure Process
- The maintainers will confirm receipt of the report within **5 business days**.
- A fix or mitigation will be discussed and planned as soon as possible.
- Once resolved, details will be disclosed publicly in the repository (via release notes or a patch commit).
- Credit will be given to the reporter if desired.
